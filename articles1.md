The president Donald Trump and Zenlensky are really want to make the grinding war to an end, when they met in the Frescoed house of Trump.  
Every  time Trump meet with Zenlensky , he call Putin before the meeting, though it didn't preclude a productive process, but it is really strange. Plus, Trump lauded Putin once again for  that he had not bombed the nuclear power plants. But Putin seems playing Trump around, I think he teased  Trump as well for his naive strategy of negotiation.  The tone and tenor of Trump is so strange , he looks like a little fancy of Putin.  Trump was child-like and unpredictable when the his first meeting with Zenlensky was devolved into such an Acrimony.  The meeting's backdrop  was not so formal, but at this time ,  none of them pronounce something after the meeting, which  Actually underscore the difficulty of the deal.

The people of Ukraine is loath to cede territory, there is perennial skirmish over there.

Although Russia Acquiesce many things 

Trump really want the Nobel Price of Peace, He is still making efforts to get it by cement the cease fire deal between Israel and Hamas.  But he have delivered a Jolt to Natanyahu, and will meet him in the next Monday.

The armada of US is still prowling on the Caribbean Sea  around the Venezuela, he want to browbeat the president Maduro , and try to topple him from his regime.
